## MNIST Digit Classification with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a simple deep learning model to classify handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**. It uses Python and TensorFlow/Keras to create and train a neural network that can accurately recognize digits from 0 to 9.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset of handwritten digits, containing:

- 60,000 training images  
- 10,000 test images  

In the notebook [`numberdeep.ipynb`](https://github.com/bakituncher/mnist/blob/main/numberdeep.ipynb), the following steps are performed:

- Loading and visualizing the dataset  
- Preprocessing and normalizing the data  
- Building and training a neural network  
- Evaluating the model  
- Making predictions and displaying results

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Installation
